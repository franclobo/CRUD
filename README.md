# CRUD
This is the  result of the tutorial to build a React Hooks + Redux CRUD Application example to consume Rest API, display and modify data with Router, Axios &amp; Bootstrap.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux.
- Gitflow.

## Getting Started

I have build a React Redux Tutorial Application with Rest API calls in that:

- Each Tutorial has id, title, description, published status.
- We can create, retrieve, update, delete Tutorials.
- There is a Search bar for finding Tutorials by title.

Here are screenshots of our React Redux CRUD Application.
